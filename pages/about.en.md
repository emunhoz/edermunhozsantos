## A quick introduction

I was born in SÃ£o Paulo and my first job was in 2008 as a designer (Yes, I started as a designer and you can view my portfolio if you want).



I studied Marketing in Bauru (IESB-PREVE) in 2012 and I starting to work as a front end.



I worked at companies like [UOL](https://www.uol.com.br/), [Yapay by Locaweb](https://www.yapay.com.br/) among others and I currently work at [Escale](https://escale.com.br/).



In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, studying new technologies and playing video games.
